## Mock Assessment

Below you will find the mock-assessment for Phase 1. This will make you familiar with the way phase assessments are performed here at DBC.

You have 2 hours to complete the work below. Remember to commit each release and push once you've finished. The assessment is open-book/code/notes/google.

It is **NOT** open cohort-mate.


You will commit EACH release and then continue to modify your code. Commit your modified code. Your final commit should look like you only did Release 4.

### Release 0
**A list of students**

X - import the csv data from students.csv
X - create an array of first names from the data and call it `student_names`
X - add 3 new names to the array
X - print out all the names on separate lines
X - commit

### Release 1

**Displaying the list accordingly with methods**

X - print out a sequential number with each name
X - print out all the names in alphabetical order
X - print all the names that start with a particular letter
X - commit

### Release 2

**Creating a class holding the list of students**

- comment out Release 0 & Relese 1 (you may need to rewrite some of the code for the following releases)
X - create a class `School`
X - create a class `Student`
X - using all the csv data, create `Student` objects
O - encapsulate all the students in the School #What does this mean? Did I do this? (with my attr_reader)
O - encapsulate the puts/sort methods from release 1 within the classes
- commit

### Release 3

**Add a cohort name for each student**

- what would be the simplest way to do it? what are all the options?
- which class' responsibility is it to hold that data? to display it?
- based on your answers to those questions, add cohort names for each student
- create a method that lists students based on cohort
- commit

### Release 4

 **Add additional characteristics of student**

- create additional characteristics of a student (your choice)
- create new students with those new properties
- eliminate argument order dependency
- implement the ability to return failing students
- write the data back to CSV
- commit and then push your code only when time is up
